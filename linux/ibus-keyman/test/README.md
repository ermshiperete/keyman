# ibus-keyman tests

## Setup

You need `pynput` to generate keypresses

`pip3 install pynput`

These tests assume that the test kmx and kmn are located in
`~/.local/share/keyman/test_kmx`.

You may like to link `common/core/desktop/tests/unit/kmx` to that location.

## Running tests

To run all the tests

```bash
./runtests.sh
```

To run an individual test `<testname>`

```bash
python3 ./test_ibus_keyman.py "<testname>"
```

If your keyboard isn't "us" then you need to set the keyboard before running the test

```bash
setxkbmap us
```

You may like to `setxkbmap -query|grep layout` before you run the test to find
out what to set it back to afterwards.

## Test output

The tests produce `<testname>.in` and `<testname>.out` files.

- `<testname>.in` is the expected output
- `<testname>.out` is the actual output

You may use `diff` or something else to compare them.
